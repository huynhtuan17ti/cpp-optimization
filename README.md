# CPP Optimization
This repository is a collection of everything relating to the topic "Optimization in C/C++" that I'm researching.

## Overview
In this repo, I split the topic into 2 smaller topics:  
1. A collection of standard provided functions/attributes/methods to optimize cpp code.
2. A collection of valuable methods/techniques from several docs to optimize cpp code.

## 1. Standard optimization
In this section, I note all provided functions/attributes/methods from the C++ standard libraries that can offer better runtime and memory consumption.

## 2. External optimzation
In this secton, it is a collection of several techniques or methods that I've read on books, papers or on some forums.
